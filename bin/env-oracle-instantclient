# This file if for setting the environment when using official Oracle Instant Client from RPM files.

#
# Installation from RPM files doesn't enable libraries with ldconfig configuration files.
#
# We can enable this by either:
#    - Setting LD_LIBRARY_PATH, commented bellow.
#      This must be done for each users.
#
#    - As root, creating a file named /etc/ld.so.conf.d/oracle-instantclient-x86_64.conf with the path to the libraries,
#      followed by a ldconfig command invocation.
#      Currently, this path is: /usr/lib/oracle/12.1/client64/lib      
#
# If we have root access, the second option is the preferred way to do things. This will make all users to have automatically
# access to libraries with the dynamic linker.
